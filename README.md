# JQuery-Christmas-lights
This is example of my code from real task.

Task: Make an animation of the Christmas lights in the header of the site.
      Christmas lights should be visible only in winter.

Solution:
      1) I made a background image layer of a Christmas tree.
      2) I made a background image layer of Christmas lights (with no lights).
      3) I made a image layer of Christmas lights (only lights) what change their opacity.
      4) Determine the current date, if the current month is 12, 1 or 2 we show Christmas lights.
